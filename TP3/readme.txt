Project description - The name of my project is the NBA Simulator. The user will be able to select an NBA team, with real NBA players and statistics, and play a simulated game against a random NBA team, controlled by the AI. The user will be playing the role as a coach, substituting players and changing the tendencies of how the team plays (Ex.) shoot more three pointers, pass the ball more, etc.). The objective of the game is to win against the AI. Good luck!How to run the project- To run the project, the user should run the TP3 file in an editor.
