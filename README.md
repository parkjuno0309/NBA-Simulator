# NBA Simulator

The NBA Simulator allows users to select their favorite team, featuing real rosters from the 2017-2018 seasons. Each player's statistics are integrated into the game through APIs to ensure realistic and dynamic gameplay. Users can adjust their team strategy during the game, choosing to make substitutions or focusing on aspects such as shooting more three-pointers or enhancing their passing game, to counter the AI-controlled opponent. All code is in one file due to course requirements.
